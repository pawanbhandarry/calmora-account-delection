    <h1>Calmora Account Deletion Instructions</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: September 28, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>We make it easy to delete your Calmora account and associated data. Deletion is permanent and irreversible â€“ all habits, mood logs, journals, and premium data will be removed from our servers (Firestore) and any backups. Local data (Hive) on your device must be handled separately (e.g., uninstall the app).</p>

    <h2>Steps to Delete Your Account</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Calmora app on your device.</li>
        <li>Go to the Settings screen (bottom navigation or menu).</li>
        <li>Scroll to "Data Management" or "Account" section.</li>
        <li>Tap "Delete Account."</li>
        <li>Confirm your identity (re-authenticate via email/password or social login).</li>
        <li>Enter a reason (optional) and confirm deletion.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="warning">Warning: This will log you out immediately. Data deletion may take up to 30 days for backups, but access is revoked instantly.</p>

    <h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your profile, habits, moods, journals, and any AI insights are deleted via Firebase.</li>
        <li>Anonymous analytics data remains (non-identifiable).</li>
        <li>If subscribed to premium, cancel via Google Play subscriptions first to avoid charges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alternative Method</h2>
    <p>If you can't access the app, email support@calmora.app with your registered email. We'll verify and process deletion within 7 days.</p>
