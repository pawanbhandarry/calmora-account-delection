    <h1>Calmora Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: September 28, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Calmora ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your data when you use our mobile app Calmora: Habit & Mood Tracker (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Email address, name, and profile details during registration (via Firebase Authentication). Optional: Social login data from Google or Apple.</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Habits, mood logs, journal entries, and settings (stored locally via Hive for offline use and synced to Firestore for cloud backup).</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, OS version, and unique identifiers for analytics and crash reporting (via Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics).</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Features:</strong> For AI insights, we process journal text via OpenAI API (anonymized; no storage by OpenAI).</li>
        <li><strong>Other:</strong> Notification preferences and export requests (e.g., CSV/PDF via dart_pdf).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect sensitive data like health records beyond what you voluntarily input (e.g., moods are self-reported).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide core features: Track habits, log moods/journals, send reminders (via Firebase Cloud Messaging), and generate insights/reports.</li>
        <li>To improve the App: Analyze usage patterns anonymously (e.g., streak calculations via Cloud Functions).</li>
        <li>For premium services: AI processing (OpenAI) and cloud sync.</li>
        <li>To communicate: Send app updates or support emails.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties, except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Service providers: Firebase (Google Cloud) for storage/auth, OpenAI for AI (data not retained).</li>
        <li>Legal requirements: If required by law or to protect rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry-standard measures (e.g., encryption in transit via Firebase) to protect your data. However, no method is 100% secure. Local data (Hive) is device-secured.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access/export data via App settings (CSV/PDF).</li>
        <li>Delete your account and data (see our <a href="deletion.html">Account Deletion Instructions</a>).</li>
        <li>Opt-out of analytics (via settings).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For EU/CA residents: GDPR/CCPA rights apply â€“ contact us for requests.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions, email us at support@calmora.app.</p>
